About me? Well, here is a blurry photo of Mt. Pilgrim Missionary Baptipst Church in Sea Breeze, North Carolina. I took this photo in July 2022. I've been working on a zine which features photography from that trip, some of my notes, and writing about what I learned about the Black history of Sea Breeze and Wilmington, NC. I've been learning Scribus for the past year or so as I've been putting the zine together. I have plans to print it Fall 2024.
