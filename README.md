#### About Me
*About me?*  Well, below is a blurry photo of Mt. Pilgrim Missionary Baptipst Church in Sea Breeze, North Carolina. I took this photo in July 2022. I've been working on a zine which features (non-blurry) photography from that trip, some of my notes, and writing about what I learned about the Black history of Sea Breeze and Wilmington, NC. I've been learning [Scribus](https://github.com/scribusproject) for the past year or so as I've been putting the zine together. I have plans to print it Fall 2024. This will be my first print publication.<br /><br /> In sum, I am an artist who enjoys learning and sharing knowledge especially as it relates to Black histories.<br /><br />
